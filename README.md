## Usage

A clean Git workflow starts with clear branch visualization. This extension helps you maintain it by
tracking merge statuses, pinpointing merge bases, and monitoring incoming/outgoing changes.

- Visualize Lineage: Understand branch relationships instantly
- Audit Merge Status: See if branches are integrated or diverging
- Merge Base: Pinpoint the common ancestor for effective merging

## Status

The codebase is in a maintenance-only state. It is stable but uses legacy patterns. The underlying
Git library [NeoGit](https://github.com/wavim/neogit), however, remains highly optimized.

Development is concluded. Unimplemented features are considered out of scope and will not be added.
This is primarily due to a shift in interests, and having an obsolete codebase. Critical bugs may be
addressed, but no ongoing support or development is guaranteed.

Thank you for your support.
