	Git Branch Master for VSCode
</h3>
<h4 align="center">Level up Inspector for Git Branches</h4>

# NOTE

The 2.x versions are buggy currently, due to bugs of isomorphic-git. It also
lacks certain features in 1.x (although it adds even more). This release is only
for first glance on visuals. For stability consider using 1.x versions.

## Overview

Git branches enable parallel development but can create messiness.  
_Git Branch Master_ helps you inspect merge statuses, identify merge bases, and
track incoming and outgoing changes for a cleaner workflow.

_Features are not limited to..._

- Quickly check the merge status of branches;
- Intuitive indicators for branch relationships;
- Identify merge base for effective merging;
- Get live status updates as changes occur;
- Monitor updates from remote branches;

## Demo

> You can conveniently copy branch name / full commit hash through item actions.

> Hovering on view items will give even more details!  
> **i.e.** For a branch, shows updated date etc.  
> **i.e.** For a commit, shows commits of the branch from merge base.
